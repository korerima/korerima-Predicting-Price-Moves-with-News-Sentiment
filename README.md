🧠 News Sentiment & Stock Return Correlation
This is a personal data science project that explores whether sentiment in financial news headlines can help predict short-term stock returns. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), time series analysis, and technical indicators using Python.

The goal is to build a replicable and extensible framework that merges news-based sentiment with historical stock price data — and tests for any meaningful correlation between the two.

📌 Features
Clean and normalize real-world financial headlines

Assign sentiment scores using the VADER NLP model

Merge with historical OHLC stock price data

Compute 1-day forward returns

Analyze correlation between sentiment and price movement

Visualize sentiment distribution, price trends, RSI, MACD, and correlation patterns

🛠️ Installation & Environment Setup
This project uses Python 3.9+ and is designed to run in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-sentiment-stock-correlation.git
cd news-sentiment-stock-correlation
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Requirements
Install required packages with pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don’t have a requirements.txt yet, here are the core dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance nltk plotly
Then, run once to download VADER’s lexicon:

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

📈 How to Use
You can run this project in Jupyter or Colab.

Start with sentiment_analysis.ipynb:

Load headlines

Clean and score sentiment using VADER

Continue in price_analysis.ipynb:

Load OHLCV stock data

Calculate SMA, RSI, MACD indicators

Visualize price movements

Finish in correlation_analysis.ipynb:

Merge headlines with prices

Compute 1-day forward returns

Analyze correlation and plot heatmaps/scatterplots

📊 Results Summary
While most correlations between sentiment and short-term return were weak or negligible, the framework serves as a useful foundation for more advanced modeling (classification, multi-day returns, FinBERT embeddings, etc.).

See final_report.docx for analysis and visualizations.

📌 Suggested Improvements
Use FinBERT or sentence embeddings instead of VADER

Try multi-day return windows (t+2, t+3)

Use machine learning to classify movement direction (up/down/flat)

Integrate macroeconomic sentiment and Reddit/Twitter signals

Deploy insights to a lightweight dashboard (e.g. Streamlit)
